This is true. We have clarified this fact from the introduction and pointed
to section 10.2 where more details have been added.

This has been corrected.

The notation has been introduce in the sentence above.

This has been rewritten.

We rewrote parts of 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 to make these concepts less shady.

This has been worded differently.

Yes.

It should indeed be x_{a,b} instead of u_{a,b} and \overline{U} instead of \overline(U)_{a,b}. Then V_{a,b} is as indicated.

All rho's have been changed to phi's.

Yes, the symmetry is the following: when phi < 0 we can fall back to case
(iii) by taking the negative of the intersection of the swapped cycles
s_b,c and s_a,b. Using a ' for the new quantities, we have
- phi' = -phi > 0
- s_a' = -s_a
- s'+ = s- and s'- = s+ (since the intersection pairing is antisymmetric)
We added this explaination to the paper. It may be longer than just looking at the picture,
but it is mathematically more satisfactory.
Moreover: we removed the case (iv) from Lemma 5.3 since it is not needed (and the statement before was wrong) and
added some missing brackets in the exponents of the cycles in this section.

The problem was with Definition 3.5. which has been updated. This should be clear now.

This has been removed.

The case a=c,b=d can be discarded by construction of the spanning tree (we added one sentence just before Thm. 5.1.). In all remaining cases the set V is disconnected and has 2 connected components.
However, we really want that s(x) is constant on the connected components, regardless of how many components V has, so we removed "disconnected".

We added some explanation on why this is possible, plus a reference to Figure 3. We also added some details in the text preceeding Figure 3.

Added references.

This has been corrected. We also replaced c by a or b in the definition of phi in the corresponding cases of the proof of Lemma 5.3.

The hypothesis was wrong indeed: the condition is lambda * sin(r) < Pi / 2
and has been introduced in the statement.

This is true, we have corrected this.

Replaced mu by -mu everywhere in the section to reduce confusion.

We liked the suggestion and added some details.

Corrected. We mean d=deg(h) throughout, except for Theorem 7.7. when d is really equal to n

They seem to be simple zeros, but we cannot prove that right now, so we added (up to multiplicity).

Corrected.

We calculate modulo Lambda (corrected), but I still would like to keep the contribution of m int_P0^Pk since it makes clear that
we split up the integration path: being able to take out the powers of zeta is really a consequence of Theorem 7.3. (I added that in a sentence)

The capital has been added on L and the field Q is now typeset in mathbb.

All occurrences have been typeset "van Wamelen".


Other changes:

p1: Added reference Frauendiener&Klein 2016 for general curves

p10: Added a second item to Remark 3.10 that explains how we actually order the differentials in practice.

p19: A factor 2 was missing in the statement of Lemma 6.5.

p25: Fixed some typos (Phi^-1 instead of Phi), changed the size of some brackets to improve readability

p27: In Remark 7.10 the number of integrals was not quite correct. In the case 0 \in X the degree of h drops down to n-1 in the case of Thm. 7.7.
and (n-1)(\nu+M) in the case of Thm. 7.9. So the computation is even easier in that case.
