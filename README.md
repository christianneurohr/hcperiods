#hcperiods

Numerical evaluation of periods of superelliptic curves to
arbitrary precision by numerical integration.

## ``gp``

initial projet, period matrix + Abel-Jacobi map for hyperelliptic curves

## ``magma``

generalization for superelliptic curves with Christian Neurohr,
complete Abel-Jacobi.

## ``arb``

arb implementation (rigorous), currently only period matrix
